# 100 Days Of Code - Log


Dia 1: Maio 18, 2019

**Progresso do dia: Assisti Aula 04 e realizei exercicios do curso JAX-WS do Alura. 
					Criei o repositorio no GB do 100DaysCode. 
					Criei o repositorio no GB da Formação Java.
					Tentei executar o Ubuntu direto do PowerShell do Windows.
					
**Pensamentos: Muito frustante entender WebService, principalmente essa parte que trata especificamente de XML, 
				preciso melhorar meu entendimento de XML.
			   Não consegui executar o comando para gerar o template do XML e abrir no Eclipse.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
